          ownership since 1947, Topper Fine Jewelers has served the San
          Francisco Bay Area
          for generations. In the current economic climate, an increasing number of our clients either wish to use their
          existing
          watches and jewelry as partial payment for a new item, or look to us to buy their items for fair value. We've
          handled
          thousands of transactions (many of them remotely) that involve buying or trading precious items. Our
          experience, ethics,
          and courteous nature cause clients to choose us over and over again. Topper Fine Jewelers is here to make your
          transaction as fair and stress free as possible. Please click on an area below for more information.</p>

              owned watches as part or all of your payment towards your new
              watch. Your old
              watch may be worth more than you think!</p>
            <p class="font-poppins text-center text-gray-600 font-normal my-3">How much is your watch worth? Value is
              dependent on the condition and market value of your watch.

              Fine Jewelers
              provides one of the most generous trade-in allowances in the industry.</p>
            <p class="font-poppins text-center text-gray-600 font-normal my-3">While every watch is not always right
              for us, we will give you a general sense of what we can do over
              the
              phone. If we
              do come to an agreement, we will expect you to send the watch back to us with a copy of the following
              <span class="font-semibold">Details and
                Declaration of Ownership</span>. When you call us please be prepared to discuss the following
              regarding
              a potential trade in.
              Each factor may affect the trade in value of your watch.
